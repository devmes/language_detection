= 002 PSR Events instead of hooks and slots

== Status

accepted

== Context

TYPO3 support the mechanisms of hooks (very old), SignalSlots (old) and modern PSR Events.

== Decision

This extension should NOT use Hooks and SignalSlots. The extension is based on PSR Events.

== Consequences

Do not the old tech stack. There is a DepTrac rule, that check the usage of SignalSlot Disptachers.
